* figwheel repl to cider
$ lein run

and stop

$ lein figwheel 

then stop

in spacemacs 
, &
cider-jack-in-clj&cljs

only clj repl will be connected

in cider clj repl buffer, start the app
(start)

then open web app in browser
try , " again

you will get connected to cljs 
in the repl try:
(js/alert "yay")

figwheel repl seems to run in browser so you need to have your browser running
the app

cljs this way doesn't use -main method
it get load from [[file:env/dev/cljs/guestbook/app.cljs::(core/init!)][dev/prod file]]

of firefox you need to delete it's global cache otherwise figwheel connect.js
will fail on hot reloading because ff keeps the version of other project
